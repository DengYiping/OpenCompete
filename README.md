# OpenCompete
An open source coding competition platform. 

## Competition Type

Competition is like Google Code-in Competition. Participants pick tasks / issues in the competition, and they will get points if they finished the task or resolve the issue.

## Proposal

I will take Codeheat as the targeting competition, the tech stack may include:

 - Angular 2
 - Scala
 - Play Framework
 - Bootstrap
